/**
 * The basic implementation of the endpoint.
 *
 * An Endpoint is a logical representation of a physical entity, such as an
 * analog phone or a channel in a trunk. Endpoints are sources or sinks of data
 * and can be physical or virtual. Physical endpoint creation requires hardware
 * installation while software is sufficient for creating a virtual Endpoint.
 * An interface on a gateway that terminates a trunk connected to a PSTN switch
 * is an example of a physical Endpoint. An audio source in an audio-content
 * server is an example of a virtual Endpoint.
